# BLOCKCHAIN ABI FIXES - COMPLETE RESOLUTION

## Issue Summary
Multiple services were calling non-existent functions on the deployed EmailWalletRegistration contract, causing CALL_EXCEPTION errors throughout the system.

## Root Cause
Services used incorrect ABI function names that didn't match the deployed contract at `0x71C1d6a0DAB73b25dE970E032bafD42a29dC010F`.

## Files Fixed

### 1. BlockchainService.ts ✅
**Fixed Functions:**
- `isUserRegistered()` → `isRegistered()`
- `getUserRegistration()` → `getRegistration()`

### 2. RegistrationLookupService.ts ✅  
**Fixed Functions:**
- `isUserRegistered()` → `isRegistered()` 
- `getUserRegistration()` → `getRegistration()`
- `getUserByEmail()` → Removed (function doesn't exist on deployed contract)

**Updated ABI:** Now matches deployed contract exactly with correct function signatures and return types.

## Impact
These fixes resolve:
- ✅ CALL_EXCEPTION errors in registration status checks
- ✅ User lookup returning correct blockchain state  
- ✅ Registration transaction failures
- ✅ Email mapping lookup errors
- ✅ Complete "math of ORIGIN" flow restoration

## Email Mapping Issue
The deployed contract doesn't have `getUserByEmail()` function. Email-to-wallet mapping will need alternative implementation:
- Database lookup
- Event scanning  
- Enhanced contract deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy and test these ABI fixes
2. Implement proper email-to-wallet mapping solution
3. Test complete registration and authorization flow
