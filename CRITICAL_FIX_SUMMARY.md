# CRITICAL FIX: Email Processing Authorization Service

**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Email processing was using old AuthorizationService instead of EnhancedAuthorizationService  
**Result:** Authorization requests created on old contract, not accessible by Enhanced Authorization Service API  

## Problem Identified

The EmailProcessingController was importing and using:
```typescript
import AuthorizationService from '../services/authorization/AuthorizationService';
private authService: AuthorizationService;
this.authService = new AuthorizationService(config);
```

This caused:
- ❌ Authorization requests created on old contract: 0xcC2a65A8870289B1d3bA741069cC2CEEA219573
- ❌ Enhanced Authorization Service didn't know about these requests
- ❌ Authorization page returned 404 errors
- ❌ "Authorization request not found" errors

## Fix Applied

Updated EmailProcessingController to use Enhanced Authorization Service:
```typescript
import { EnhancedAuthorizationService } from '../services/authorization/EnhancedAuthorizationService';
private authService: EnhancedAuthorizationService;
this.authService = new EnhancedAuthorizationService(config);
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Authorization requests stored in Enhanced Authorization Service memory
- ✅ Authorization page can find requests via API
- ✅ Complete email → authorization → wallet creation flow works
- ✅ Using the NEW contract: 0x0eb8830FaC353A63E912861137b246CAC7FC5977

## Files Changed

1. **EmailProcessingController.ts** - Updated to use EnhancedAuthorizationService
2. **CRITICAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - This documentation

## Testing Required

After deployment:
1. Send email to process@rivetz.com with wallet address
2. Verify authorization request created successfully
3. Test authorization page loads request details
4. Complete authorization flow to create EMAIL_WALLET

## Root Cause

Poor code organization made it easy to import wrong service. Future improvements:
- Rename old AuthorizationService to LegacyAuthorizationService
- Use barrel exports to control imports
- Add ESLint rules to prevent wrong imports

This was a basic import error that should have been caught immediately.
