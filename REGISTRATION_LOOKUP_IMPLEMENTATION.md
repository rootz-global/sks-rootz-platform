# Registration Lookup Service Implementation - September 15, 2025

## CRITICAL FIX: Email-to-Wallet Registration Mapping

This commit adds proper registration lookup functionality to fix the core issue where email processing was parsing wallet addresses from email subject lines instead of using proper registration contract lookups.

## Files Added:

### 1. RegistrationLookupService.ts
- **Purpose**: Proper email-to-wallet address mapping using registration contract
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getWalletByEmail(email)` - Look up registered wallet for email address
  - `isUserRegistered(address)` - Verify registration status
  - `validateEmailWalletMapping(email, expectedWallet)` - Validate mapping

### 2. RegistrationTestController.ts
- **Purpose**: Test endpoints for debugging registration issues
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /.rootz/test/registration-lookup?email=steven@sprague.com`
  - `GET /.rootz/test/user-registration?address=0x107C5655ce50AB9744Fc36A4e9935E30d4923d0b`
  - `GET /.rootz/test/validate-mapping?email=steven@sprague.com&wallet=0x107C...`

### 3. Updated testRoutes.ts
- Added registration test endpoints to existing test router
- Integrated RegistrationTestController into route handling

## Problem Being Solved:

### Previous Broken Flow:
```
Email from steven@sprague.com → Parse wallet from subject line → Try to create DATA_WALLET → Contract rejects
```

### New Correct Flow:
```
Email from steven@sprague.com → Registration lookup → Find registered wallet → Create DATA_WALLET for registered user
```

## Enhanced Contract Integration:

The enhanced contract at `0x0eb8830FaC353A63E912861137b246CAC7FC5977` validates that users are properly registered before allowing DATA_WALLET creation. This service ensures proper registration lookup instead of parsing addresses from email subjects.

## Testing After Deployment:

1. Test email lookup:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/.rootz/test/registration-lookup?email=steven@sprague.com"
   ```

2. Validate mapping:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/.rootz/test/validate-mapping?email=steven@sprague.com&wallet=0x107C5655ce50AB9744Fc36A4e9935E30d4923d0b"
   ```

3. Check user registration:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/.rootz/test/user-registration?address=0x107C5655ce50AB9744Fc36A4e9935E30d4923d0b"
   ```

## Expected Results:

If `steven@sprague.com` is properly registered with wallet `0x107C5655ce50AB9744Fc36A4e9935E30d4923d0b`, the lookup should return this mapping. If not registered, this explains why the enhanced contract is rejecting transactions.

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy and test registration lookup
2. If mapping doesn't exist, register `steven@sprague.com` with the wallet
3. Update email processing to use registration lookup instead of subject parsing
4. Retest email-to-DATA_WALLET creation flow

This addresses the root cause of contract transaction failures by ensuring proper registration validation.
