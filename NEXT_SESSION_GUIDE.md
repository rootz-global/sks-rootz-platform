# EMAIL WALLET SYSTEM - NEXT SESSION GUIDE

**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Session Duration:** 3+ hours intensive debugging and architecture migration  
**Status:** MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGE DEPLOYED - Testing Required  

## CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEW CHAT

### IMMEDIATE ISSUE RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Multi-contract architecture with ABI mismatches causing CALL_EXCEPTION failures
- **Solution:** Migrated to unified EmailDataWalletOS_Secure contract
- **Status:** Code deployed, server restart required for testing

### CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATE

**Server:** Ubuntu at rootz.global  
**Project:** `/opt/sks-rootz-platform/`  
**Architecture:** EPISTERY pattern with unified blockchain contract  

**Contract Migration:**
- OLD: 3 separate contracts (Registration, Authorization, EmailData)
- NEW: 1 unified contract `EmailDataWalletOS_Secure` at `0x0eb8830FaC353A63E912861137b246CAC7FC5977`

## FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION

### 1. Core Architecture Changes
- **`src/services/BlockchainService.ts`** - Complete rewrite for unified contract
- **`src/services/RegistrationLookupService.ts`** - Updated for unified contract
- **`config/localhost/config.ini`** - New unified configuration format
- **`.gitignore`** - Added config file security exclusions

### 2. Configuration Format Changes
**NEW INI Structure:**
```ini
[blockchain]
unifiedContract=0x0eb8830FaC353A63E912861137b246CAC7FC5977

[email.microsoftGraph]  # Changed from [email]
enabled=true
tenantId=...
clientId=...
clientSecret=...
```

### 3. ABI Changes
- **Removed:** Separate contract ABIs for Registration/Authorization/EmailData
- **Added:** Single unified ABI with all functions
- **Updated:** Function names to match deployed contract (isRegistered vs isUserRegistered)

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Completed Steps
1. ✅ Code changes committed and pushed to main branch
2. ✅ Server pulled latest changes (git pull origin main completed)
3. ⚠️ **PENDING:** Server config update with unified format
4. ⚠️ **PENDING:** Service restart and testing

### Next Required Steps
1. **Update server config:** `~/.data-wallet/localhost/config.ini` with unified format
2. **Build TypeScript:** `npm run build`
3. **Restart service:** `npm start`
4. **Test endpoints:** Registration and wallet creation

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### New Unified Contract Functions
```typescript
// Registration
registerUser(address userWallet, string email) payable returns (bytes32 userId)
isRegistered(address userWallet) view returns (bool)
getCreditBalance(address userWallet) view returns (uint256)

// Email Wallet Creation  
createWalletWithAuthorization(address userWallet, string email, string subject, string sender, bytes32 contentHash, string ipfsHash) returns (bytes32 walletId)
```

### Service Flow Simplification
- **OLD:** Complex user authorization with MetaMask signatures
- **NEW:** Direct service-owner wallet creation for registered users
- **Benefit:** Eliminates CALL_EXCEPTION and authorization complexity

## CURRENT TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/.rootz/status
# Expected: Shows unified contract address, service is owner
```

### 2. Registration Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/.rootz/email-wallet/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userAddress":"0xe92BC061B9915Cf0fD9bA6C369fA7d3A26345709",
    "signature":"test", 
    "message":"Register wallet for EMAIL_WALLET service\nEmail: steven@rivetz.com\nName: Steven\nWallet: 0xe92BC061B9915Cf0fD9bA6C369fA7d3A26345709"
  }'
# Expected: Success with transaction hash (not CALL_EXCEPTION)
```

### 3. Email Monitoring
- **Service:** GraphEmailMonitorService
- **Config:** Updated to use `[email.microsoftGraph]` section
- **Status:** Should initialize without errors

## KNOWN ISSUES TO MONITOR

### 1. Configuration Dependencies
- **Risk:** Other services may still reference old contract addresses
- **Solution:** Update as errors occur, following unified contract pattern

### 2. Email Processing Integration
- **Status:** GraphEmailMonitorService updated to read new config format
- **Test:** Ensure email monitoring starts without configuration errors

### 3. Database Integration
- **Status:** Database services should be unaffected by blockchain changes
- **Monitor:** Check that database operations continue working

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Immediate Success (Next Hour)
- ✅ Service starts without "contract address not found" errors
- ✅ Health endpoint returns unified contract information
- ✅ Registration attempts return success (not CALL_EXCEPTION)

### Full Success (End-to-End)
- ✅ Users can register with email addresses
- ✅ Email monitoring detects and processes incoming emails
- ✅ Email wallets created automatically with proper authorization
- ✅ Complete email-to-blockchain-wallet pipeline working

## ROLLBACK PLAN

If unified contract architecture fails:
1. **Immediate:** Check specific error messages in service logs
2. **Config Fix:** Verify unified contract address is correct and accessible
3. **ABI Fix:** Ensure function names match deployed contract exactly
4. **Emergency:** Revert to previous git commit if fundamental issues

## ARCHITECTURAL DEBT CREATED

### Positive Changes
- ✅ Eliminated complex multi-contract coordination
- ✅ Simplified transaction flow (service-owner operations)
- ✅ Single source of truth for all blockchain operations
- ✅ Reduced ABI complexity and maintenance

### Technical Debt Added
- ⚠️ Other services may still reference legacy contract addresses
- ⚠️ Configuration format changes may affect other components
- ⚠️ Need to verify all service integrations work with unified approach

## COMMUNICATION PRIORITY

**For Next Session:**
1. **First Priority:** Complete server deployment and test basic functionality
2. **Second Priority:** Verify email processing pipeline works end-to-end
3. **Third Priority:** Address any remaining service integration issues

**Key Phrase for AI:** "Unified contract architecture migration completed, testing deployment"

---

**SUMMARY:** Major architectural migration from multi-contract to unified contract approach. Code deployed, server restart pending. Primary goal is to eliminate CALL_EXCEPTION failures and establish working email-to-blockchain pipeline.
