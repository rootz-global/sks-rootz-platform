git commit -m "FIX: GraphEmailMonitorService now uses working RegistrationLookupService

Issue: Email monitoring was using direct blockchain contract calls instead
of the fixed RegistrationLookupService, causing email processing failures.

Root Cause:
- GraphEmailMonitorService.determineRecipientWallet() called contract directly
- Did not use the RegistrationLookupService that was already fixed
- This caused different behavior between test endpoints (working) and email processing (broken)

Fix Applied:
- Import RegistrationLookupService in GraphEmailMonitorService
- Replace direct contract calls with registrationLookupService.getWalletByEmail()
- Use the same working lookup method across all services
- Added initialization logging to confirm fix is active

Expected Result:
- Email processing now finds registered wallets correctly
- Same behavior between test endpoints and email processing
- Complete email-to-blockchain pipeline functional

Files Changed:
- src/services/GraphEmailMonitorService.ts - Use fixed RegistrationLookupService"
